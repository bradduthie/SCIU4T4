This is especially important in any module (for example, this one) where you are required to put numeric answers into a test or exam, as the computer will only recognise the answer as being correct if it is expressed in the way stated in the question. If you are unfamiliar with how to work out the right number of decimal places or significant figures, then these guides should be useful, although there are many other web-sources that would explain the concepts too.
